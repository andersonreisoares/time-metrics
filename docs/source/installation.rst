Installation
==============

**stmetrics** is mostly written in python, however, due to the spatial-temporal segmentation algorithm available it requires C++ compiler. Please, prior to install, check the required dependecies at :ref:`depend-ref`. Configuring this compiler is the critical step in getting the spatial-temporal algorithm running.
